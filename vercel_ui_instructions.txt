# Vercel Project Configuration Instructions

Please follow these steps carefully to configure your Vercel project settings.
These settings, combined with the simplified `vercel.json` file (which only contains `rewrites`), will correctly deploy your monorepo project.

## Step 1: Update `vercel.json` (if you haven't already)

1.  Ensure you have moved the `root_vercel.json` file to the **root** of your `ximonse.github.io` repository.
2.  Rename it to `vercel.json`.
3.  The content of this `vercel.json` file should be:
    ```json
    {
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/api/gemini",
          "destination": "/api/gemini"
        },
        {
          "source": "/(.*)",
          "destination": "/index.html"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    (Note: This file should NOT contain a "builds" section.)

## Step 2: Configure Vercel Project Settings (UI)

Go to your Vercel project dashboard for `spatial-view` and navigate to `Settings -> General`.

### A. Build & Development Settings

Locate the "Build & Development Settings" section and configure the following fields precisely:

*   **Framework Preset:** Select `Vite`
*   **Build Command:** Enter `cd spatial-view && npm run build`
*   **Output Directory:** Enter `spatial-view/dist`
*   **Install Command:** Enter `cd spatial-view && npm install`

### B. Root Directory

Locate the "Root Directory" field.

*   **Root Directory:** Ensure this field is **empty**. Do NOT set it to `spatial-view`.

## Step 3: Deploy

After making these changes, trigger a new deployment on Vercel. This can usually be done by pushing a small change to your repository or by manually triggering a redeploy from the Vercel dashboard.

This configuration ensures that Vercel correctly builds your project from the `spatial-view` subdirectory and routes API calls and frontend requests as intended.
