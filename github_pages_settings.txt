# Final Instructions: Configure GitHub Pages Source

This is the final and most critical step. The errors you are seeing are because GitHub is serving your source code directly, instead of serving the built files.

You need to tell GitHub to serve the content from the `gh-pages` branch, which is where our automated workflow is placing the final, built version of your site.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1.  **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
    Open a web browser and navigate to: `https://github.com/ximonse/ximonse.github.io`

2.  **Open Settings:**
    Click on the "Settings" tab, located near the top of the page.

3.  **Go to Pages:**
    In the left-hand sidebar, click on "Pages".

4.  **Configure the Source:**
    You will see a section named "Build and deployment".
    *   Under "Source", make sure `Deploy from a branch` is selected.
    *   Under "Branch", use the dropdown menu to select `gh-pages` as the branch. The folder should be set to `/(root)`.

    The setting should look like this:
    **Branch: `gh-pages` / `(root)`**

5.  **Save Changes:**
    Click the "Save" button next to the branch selection.

## What Happens Next

After you save, GitHub Pages will update to serve the files from the `gh-pages` branch. This branch contains the `index.html` and asset files that were correctly processed by the Vite build system.

It might take a minute or two for the change to take effect. You can then refresh `https://ximonse.github.io/spatial-view/` and it should now load correctly.

This is the last piece of the puzzle. I cannot perform this step for you as it requires access to your repository's settings.
